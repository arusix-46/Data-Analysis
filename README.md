# Data-Analysis

This project provides a thorough analysis of three datasets, focusing on their central tendency measures: mean, median, maximum, and minimum values. Additionally, it explores the implementation of graph-based algorithms to understand the structural properties of these datasets. Specifically, the study employs Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithms, including Prim's, Kruskal's, Dijkstra's, and Bellman-Ford algorithms.

By leveraging these algorithms, the project aims to reveal underlying patterns and connections within the datasets. Prim’s and Kruskal’s algorithms are utilized for constructing MSTs, highlighting the most efficient pathways and connections. Meanwhile, Dijkstra's and Bellman-Ford algorithms are explored for their capabilities in finding the shortest paths, further enriching the analysis.

The integration of these algorithmic techniques with the statistical measures provides a comprehensive view of the datasets, offering deeper insights and valuable outcomes. This dual approach not only enhances the understanding of central tendency in the datasets but also demonstrates the practical applications of graph theory in data analysis.

Through this detailed examination, the project emphasizes the importance of combining statistical methods with advanced algorithms to achieve robust data analysis and meaningful interpretations.
